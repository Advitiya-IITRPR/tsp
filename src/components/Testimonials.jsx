                        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8 text-xl">Hello everyone. This is Ayush Saini and I would like to share my experience of Advitiya 2020.
                            I got the opportunity to visit the technical fest of IIT Ropar, as an 11th grader in February 2020. This became possible through the Advitiya Open Olympiad. It was a great experience. I attended exhibitions by the Indian Army and ISRO. And I even got the opportunity of attending a lecture from a former ISRO chairman, Dr K Radhakrishnan and some other reputed authors, whose names I fail to recollect at the moment.
                            Also, I was exposed to the world of robotics and drone competitions for the first time, despite being just a school student.
                            Moreover, I got to know a lot about residential college life, and engineering as a whole. I am deeply grateful to IIT Ropar for having me as a guest and extending their warm hospitality to me. The learning experience here shall be remembered by me throughout my life.

                            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8 text-xl">Hey
                                This is Mohit Bhuria currently pursuing computer science from IIT Ropar want to share my experience of a blissful day of my life -'Advitiya ' a full-day amalgam of science, technology, fun, entertainment, innovation and research at I.I.T ROPAR is a most awaited day for any engineer who is interested in technology and innovation. It would help you to explore the world of Robotics, coding, quizzing, gaming, workshop MUN, and much more in the same way as it helped me to learn and explore. I got a chance to attend Advitiya when I was an IIT JEE Aspirant through the 'Advitiya Open Olympiad 'in which I was ranked 2nd. It was a whole new experience for me which gave me the motivation to study hard and get into a college like I.I.T ROPAR. Exhibitions organized by Indian Army and I.S.R.O. were well interactive and helped exhibitors to learn and explore new things.
                                Overall, the experience was virtuous and was worth attending
